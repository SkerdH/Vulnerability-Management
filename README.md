<h1>OpenVAS Vulnerability Management</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project Objectives:

The primary objective of this project is to create a functional Azure-based Vulnerability Management Lab for the purpose of scanning, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. This lab is intended to enhance understanding and practical experience in vulnerability management processes and tools.

Project Scope:            
Creation of an Azure environment with required virtual machines.
Deployment of OpenVAS, a vulnerability scanning tool, in the lab.
Configuration of a vulnerable Windows 10 virtual machine.
Performing unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans.
Implementing security configurations within the Windows 10 VM.
Remediation of vulnerabilities identified during the scans.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>OpenVAS</b> 
- <b>Microsoft Remote Desktop</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10/b> (21H2)
- <b>Azure/b>

<br />
Set up virtual machine in azure:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Use powershell to ssh into the virtual machine <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once inside it should look like this <br/>

<br />
<br />
The console will give you an ip address you can go to to manage everything inside, and will include and user and password <br/>

<br />
<br />
Create a new virtual machine using windows 10 pro os. This will be used to test Vulnerabilities <br/>

<br />
<br />
Use remote desktop to connect to the virtual machine. Once inside the goal is to make the VM vulerable, first start by disabling the firewall. Next
  install old versions of FireFox, VLC Player, Adobe Reader. Restart VM. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Log back into OpenVAS. Click assets, hosts, then make a new host using the private ip address of the VM. <br/>

<br />
<br />
To create an unauthenticated scan create a new target with following settings. Next create a scam using the created target   <br/>

<br />
<br />
The completed scan should look like this. Once the scan is finished, click the date under “Last Report” to see the results. Next part will
  make changes inside the Windows 10 VM in order to allow for an authenticated scan of the system<br/>

<br />
<br />
Next go into Windows 10 VM and disable Windows Firewall ,disable User Account Control. enable Remote Registry,
Set Registry Key to Launch Registry Editor (regedit.exe) in “Run as administrator” mode and grant Admin Approval, if requested
Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive
Open SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System key
Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value with the following properties:  Name: LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy  Value: 1
<br/>

<br />
<br />
Go to Configuration → Credentials → New Credential Name / Comment → “Azure VM Credentials”
Allow Insecure Use:, Yes Username: azureuser Password: Cyberlab123!,Save
 <br/>

<br />
<br />
Within Greenbone / OpenVAS, go to Scans → Tasks, Click the Play button to launch the new Credentialed Scan, wait for it to finish
<br/>

<br />
<br />
Once the program is finished you wil be able to see the credentialed scan now includes many more threats <br/>

<br />
<br />
The program will show threats and remediation  <br/>
